# Sample App: Force.com Development with Heroku

### Fork this repo

By forking it to your own Github account, you can start editing code right away after setting things up

### Clone your repo to your local computer

    $ git clone https://github.com/yourgithubuserororg/sfdx-simple.git

### Set everything up 

    $ heroku pipelines:setup

Answer all the prompts and when finished, your browser will open on a newly created pipeline. Depending on how you answered the prompts, review apps will be created automatically on new pull requests and tests will run on new commits.

Note, Review apps are not really useful at this point. That may be addressed in the future.
